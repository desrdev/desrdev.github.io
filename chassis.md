## Chassis

if anyone wants to take the side pannels off their psx, there is a metal tab between the side panel and the psx, get a screw driver and lift it up, then you can slide the pannel towards the back
if someone does this and their side panel still has it's posts please let me know as mine are snapped off and i'd like to print a replacement

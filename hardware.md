## Hardware Revisions
Every PSX hardware revision has two releases and is specified with a 4 digit product code: `DESR-****`. The second digit (`0/1/5/7`) specifies the hardware revision. First digit (`5/7`) defines hard drive size and some minor features. The `7*00` is constructed with a glossy case and has blue lettering.

## Hardware Changes
Collected from marketing materials and other online resources. Needs to be confirmed.
- `5000/7000`: First revision.
- `5100/7100`: Unknown changes, Japanese Wikipedia article suggests it's just bundled hardware changes.
- `5500/7500`: High quality over the air signal filtering removed from `*500` models, firewire added to 7500. psBB support removed. Update disk allows software encoding DVR videos for PSP (slow).
- `5700/7700`: Same as `*500` but additional ASIC for hardware encoding PSP video.

All PSX revisions use the combo EE+GS main chip, and the original MIPS IOP, not a DECKARD.

`*500/*700` systems refuse to properly boot up without the DVR partition. Cannot use sony ps2 branded HDD's to restore these models

## Internal Naming
Within PSX related binaries, the `*000/*100` are named PSX1 and the `*500/*700` are named PSX2.
